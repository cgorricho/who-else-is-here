# Strategic Opportunities Brainstorming Session - "Who Else Is Here"

**Session Date:** October 9, 2025 - Evening Session
**Document Created:** 202510092157
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** Event Networking App Developer
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Continue Tomorrow

## Session Overview

**Session Goals:** Explore alternative business models, GTM strategies, and partnership opportunities for "Who Else Is Here" networking app

**Techniques Used:** Role Playing (#16) - Stakeholder perspective exploration
**Areas Explored:** Event organizers, sponsors/exhibitors, attendees
**Key Discovery:** Dual-sided marketplace with multiple revenue streams

---

## Major Strategic Breakthroughs

### 🎯 **Dual Revenue Stream Model Discovered**
- **Side A (B2B):** Event organizers pay for analytics and management features
- **Side B (B2C):** Attendees pay for enhanced networking experiences
- **Revolutionary insight:** Each side increases value for the other side

### 🏢 **Three Distinct User Categories Identified**
1. **Regular Attendees** - Networking with peers
2. **Sponsor/Exhibitor Booth Staff** - Lead generation and qualification
3. **Event Organizers** - Event success analytics and management

### 📊 **Analytics as Premium Value Driver**
Event organizers have **zero visibility** into networking activity during events. Our app provides the ONLY data source for real networking engagement.

## Detailed Findings by Stakeholder

## 1. Event Organizers (B2B Revenue Stream)

### **Pain Points Identified:**
- **Black box problem:** Know registration + attendance, but ZERO data on actual networking activity
- Need to prove ROI to sponsors and justify ticket prices
- Want to differentiate their events with value-added features
- Struggle to measure event success beyond attendance

### **Value Propositions:**
- **Networking Success Analytics:** Real-time data on connections made, engagement patterns
- **Sponsor ROI Metrics:** Prove sponsor booth effectiveness with connection data
- **Event Differentiation:** Market events as having "enhanced networking capabilities"
- **Repeat Attendance Driver:** Better networking experience = higher retention

### **Pricing Model: Per-Event (Organizer-Friendly)**

**Tier 1: Basic Analytics - $100/event**
- Event setup + QR code generation
- Basic attendee tracking (who joined, total connections)
- Simple metrics: "247 connections made at your event"

**Tier 2: Pro Analytics - $400/event**
- Real-time networking dashboard
- Session-level analytics
- Top connectors report
- Networking hotspot analysis

**Tier 3: Premium Analytics - $1,000/event**
- Sponsor ROI analytics
- Post-event networking reports
- Attendee engagement scoring
- Custom branding on app

### **ROI Validation:**
- Small events (100 attendees): $100-1,000 vs. $2,000-4,000 budget = 2.5-25%
- Large events (1,000 attendees): $1,000 vs. $100,000+ budget = 1%
- **Potential ROI for organizers:** 10x+ through improved retention, sponsor satisfaction

---

## 2. Sponsors/Exhibitors (Revenue via Organizer Partnership)

### **Strategic Approach:**
- **No direct sponsor sales** - work exclusively through event organizers
- Organizers can charge sponsors premium for "enhanced networking access"
- Revenue sharing or discounted organizer tiers as compensation

### **Key Insight: Connection Analytics vs. Demographics**
- **Our app focus:** Real-time networking behavior and connection success
- **NOT demographic profiling** (organizers already have registration data)
- **Value:** Track ENGAGEMENT and CONNECTIONS, not just foot traffic

### **Sponsor Value Propositions:**
- **Lead qualification through networking behavior:** See who actively networks vs. passive attendees
- **Booth interaction tracking:** "Your booth staff connected with 15 attendees this hour"
- **Connection success metrics:** "Booth conversations led to 8 LinkedIn connections"
- **Follow-up data:** Contact info of people who genuinely engaged with booth staff
- **ROI measurement:** Connection analytics vs. traditional badge scan counts

### **Organizer's Sales Pitch to Sponsors:**
*"Track real networking ROI and meaningful connections, not just foot traffic"*

**Potential sponsor premium:** $500-1,500 more per booth for connection analytics

## 3. Attendees (B2C Revenue Stream)

### **Pricing Philosophy:**
- **Per-event pricing** (not monthly subscription)
- Networking is episodic, not continuous
- Price points that feel reasonable for single-event value

### **Three-Tier Attendee Model:**

**Tier 1: Basic (FREE)**
- Attendee list with basic info
- LinkedIn links for LinkedIn users
- Contact save for non-LinkedIn users

**Tier 2: Smart Networking ($9.99/event)**
- AI affinity matching based on LinkedIn profiles
- **PROXIMITY SORTING** - see people closest to you first
- Enhanced profile insights
- "People you should meet" recommendations

**Tier 3: Power Networking ($19.99/event)**
- Automated LinkedIn outreach (policy compliant)
- Follow-up tracking and reminders
- Connection success analytics
- Priority proximity alerts

### **Revolutionary Feature: Smart Recommendation Engine**

**The Flow:**
1. AI analyzes attendee profile (LinkedIn data, stated goals)
2. Identifies potential matches at the event
3. Prioritizes by proximity (people near you get priority)
4. Suggests connections with rationale
5. User accepts/declines recommendations (PRIVATE)
6. AI learns preferences for better future matching

**Accept/Decline/Maybe Later System:**
- **Private only** - no mutual matching complexity
- AI learns user preferences over time
- Gets smarter about networking style and interests
- Quality over quantity approach

### **Proximity Feature Innovation:**
- GPS-based attendee sorting with user permission
- "3 high-affinity matches at your table, 2 at the next table"
- Real-time alerts: "Sarah (95% match) just sat down across from you"
- Solves the problem of finding the right people in large events

## Key Strategic Insights

### **1. Dual-Sided Marketplace Dynamics**
- Organizers pay for event insights and management
- Attendees pay for networking advantages
- Each side increases value for the other
- Network effects: more attendees = better matching, better analytics for organizers

### **2. Three Revenue Streams Identified**
1. **Event organizer subscriptions** ($100-1,000 per event)
2. **Attendee upgrades** ($10-20 per event per person)
3. **Sponsor premium services** (via organizer revenue sharing)

### **3. Analytics as Differentiator**
- Only app providing real networking engagement data
- Transforms "black box" of event networking into measurable ROI
- Critical for event organizers to justify costs and prove value

### **4. Proximity + AI Matching = Competitive Moat**
- Technical sophistication beyond simple attendee lists
- Real-time location awareness with permission
- Learning algorithm that improves with usage
- Quality networking over quantity connections

## Implementation Boundaries (KISS Principle Maintained)

### **What We WON'T Do:**
- No registration platform integration
- No demographic profiling from external sources
- No mutual matching (dating app complexity)
- No direct sponsor network building

  - Attendee basic functionality and upgrade motivation
  - Proximity feature technical implementation
  - AI matching effectiveness
