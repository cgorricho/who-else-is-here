## 2. Professional Identity & Positioning

Carlos Gorricho is a **CFO-turned-AI practitioner** — a rare hybrid executive who combines 25+ years of C-suite financial leadership across multinational corporations with hands-on, production-grade AI/ML development skills acquired since 2022.

His core identity sits at the intersection of:

- **Executive strategic leadership** (CFO, VP, CEO, Co-Secretary General roles)
- **Financial engineering** (capital markets, FP&A, risk management, operational finance)
- **AI/ML technical implementation** (agentic systems, RAG architectures, full-stack AI products)
- **Management consulting** (Heptagon Group — his own firm, founded 2012)

This combination is genuinely uncommon: Carlos doesn't just understand AI as a strategy topic — he has built production systems, written thousands of lines of code, and deployed working applications. At the same time, he's not a career software engineer; he brings the business judgment, stakeholder communication skills, and organizational leadership of a seasoned C-suite executive.

**Key persona for agents to internalize:** *"The CFO who codes"* — someone who can walk into a boardroom to discuss capital allocation strategy, and then sit down with an engineering team to review architecture decisions on an AI system.
